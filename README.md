# LLM Jailbreak

Welcome to the **LLM Jailbreak** repository! This project focuses on techniques and tools to bypass limitations and restrictions in large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT-4, allowing you to unlock their full potential.

## Features

- **15 Jailbreak Methods**: Code implementations of 15 different jailbreak methods compiled from research papers.
- **Techniques**: Comprehensive documentation on various jailbreak methods.
- **Tools**: Scripts and utilities to implement jailbreak techniques.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for applying jailbreaks on different LLMs.
- **Community Contributions**: Share and discuss new methods and tools.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-jailbreak.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```sh
    cd llm-jailbreak
    ```
3. **Explore the documentation**: Start with the `README.md` and explore the `/docs` folder for detailed guides.

## Language-Specific Effectiveness

Research indicates that jailbreak methods tend to be more effective in languages that are less commonly used for training LLMs. For instance, English may pose more challenges due to its extensive use in training data, while languages like Korean may be easier for jailbreak attempts. Therefore, we recommend starting with Korean and then translating the techniques to your preferred language.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions from the community! Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, and share your jailbreak techniques. Please follow our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
